SHORT DESCRIPTION:
==================

VClassed allow you to simply and quickly register/deregister classes and to
create new instances of registered classes. The interface is PM and is quite
clear so no help is provided for the program. If you know what WPS classes are
you won't probably need more help. (If you have problems write me a the adress
below).

P.S.
Maybe i'll write some doc for the next version
